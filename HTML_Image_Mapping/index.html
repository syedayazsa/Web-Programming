        <h2>Basics of Fielding Positions in Cricket</h2>
        <p>In terms of fielding positions, I like to divide the cricket field into 3 parts:</p>
        <p><strong>The Close Catching Infield</strong> – This area contains the fielders that are the closest to the batsman. Everyone inside this ring will be about 15 yards away or closer! These are often specialist catching positions, with a bit less of a focus on saving runs! If you look at the diagram of the cricket field I included above, the close catching infield is represented by the smallest circle in the centre of the diagram.</p>
        <p><strong>The Inner Ring – </strong>This area contains the fielders that will usually be looking to stop the batsmen running singles. Fielders in this area will usually be somewhere up to 30 yards away from the batsman! If you’re fielding in the inner ring, make sure you’re getting yourself in a nice balanced position as the ball is bowled. You should be on your toes, ready to spring left or right in the direction of the ball if it is hit towards you. The inner ring is represented by the second smallest circle on the diagram.</p>
        <p><strong>The Outfield –</strong>This zone contains all the other areas right up until the boundary on all sides of the wicket. Fielders placed in this zone will be there primarily to stop the batsman hitting the ball for boundaries. The outfield is represented by the largest circle in the diagram.</p>
